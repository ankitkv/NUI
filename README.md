3D Natural User Interface for Operating Systems
===============================================

The purpose of this project is to make the operating system shell take advantage of the advent of stereoscopic 3D displays in market. Windows and window controls are projected in 3D space and the user can interact with them by touching the perceived positions of the windows in space, not the screen.

Thus the user can move and touch window controls in 3D space. The 3D display is implemented via the compiz compositor, and the input is implemented via OpenNI and OpenCV.
